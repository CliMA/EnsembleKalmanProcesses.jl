# EnsembleKalmanProcesses

`EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl` (EKP) is a library of derivative-free Bayesian optimization techniques based on ensemble Kalman Filters, a well known family of approximate filters used for data assimilation. The tools in this library enable fitting parameters found in expensive black-box computer codes without the need for adjoints or derivatives. This property makes them particularly useful when calibrating non-deterministic models, or when the training data are noisy.

Currently, the following methods are implemented in the library:
 - Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) - The traditional optimization technique based on the (perturbed-observation-based) Ensemble Kalman Filter EnKF ([Iglesias, Law, Stuart, 2013](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0266-5611/29/4/045001)),
 - Ensemble Transform Kalman Inversion (ETKI) - An optimization technique based on the (square-root-based) ensemble transform Kalman filter  ([Bishop et al., 2001](http://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2001)129<0420:ASWTET>2.0.CO;2), [Huang et al., 2022](http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6420/ac99fa)),
 - Gauss Newton Kalman Inversion (GNKI) [a.k.a. Iterative Ensemble Kalman Filter with Satistical Linearization] - An optimization technique based on the Gauss Newton optimization update and the iterative extended Kalman filter ([Chada et al, 2020](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2010.13299)),
 - Ensemble Kalman Sampler (EKS) - also obtains a Gaussian Approximation of the posterior distribution, through a Monte Carlo integration ([Garbuno-Inigo, Hoffmann, Li, Stuart, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M1251655)),
 - Unscented Kalman Inversion (UKI) - also obtains a Gaussian Approximation of the posterior distribution, through a quadrature based integration approach ([Huang, Schneider, Stuart, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111262)),
- Sparsity-inducing Ensemble Kalman Inversion (SEKI) - Additionally adds approximate ``L^0`` and ``L^1`` penalization to the EKI ([Schneider, Stuart, Wu, 2020](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2007.06175)).
